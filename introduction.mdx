## Understanding where I come from

Being a native in ETH as I read through the whitepaper, I have allocated most of the time to join communities bred from the Ethereum Ecosystem.
Coming from the BTC Hard Fork to Bitcoin Cash back in 2017, I started as a minor investor into early ETH applications, tokens and also games from different chains.

## What's left 

Why do I use a document setup from Mintlify? I'm broke, so I need some money to buy the domain. Also, using notion is too based.
