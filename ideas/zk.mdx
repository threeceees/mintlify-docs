## ZK Proofing attainment in blockchain implementation.
Zero knowledge is a sentiment that is tied to cryptographic logic to solve a certain problem with two different parties which include the provers and a verifier.
The prover will submit an attestment with either a correct or wrong statement which the prover has to attest to be always true for the right statement for the receiving verifier. By instilling this within the transaction query with the new advancing protocols such as newly instilled zkEVM in the usage of Polygon zkEVM and zkSnark.
The verifier will always have a end goal of verification request as to prove the trueness in all of cryptographic handling, making sure the security of every occuring transaction to be faultless and sound.

Such programmibility in problem solving is crucial in how Ethereum is further scaled down as more developers deploy with EVM, adding enhanced reliability, code auditing and attestment. By having an attestment form factor of understanding that the statement is proven in an honest way of trueness, more applications can have a handling of bypassing a statement.
