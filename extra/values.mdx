## Understanding the markets

I am a key believer in different markets, encompassing blockchain itself with other types of industries. NFTs and DeFi has brought in many opportunities,
and also creates many use-case for study. Encompassing different pre-existing Web2 technology, such as data-analytics, finance, kickstarting programs, RWA lending and so much more.
Much people on the contrary saw blockchain as a tool of incomprehensible finance and irregular investment, some may even sway away from it. By understanding new tech stacks coming forward,
and also new chains created by many other companies to scale, I believe in the idea of scaling decentralization. DeFi will displace networks and capture trillions of dollars, but this will happen 
on slow infrastructure change cycles.

New and more nascent technology will continously exist to tackle the pre-existing market. Therefore, Web3 people are there to chase after provenance.

I am also a key believer in a few of the industry markets below:

### Industries

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="hexagon" title="Blockchain">
    As specified above, blockchain will need to scale towards the standard of encompassing more users, tons of people have a common goal now on scaling messaging, transactional speed for blockchain. As to tackle the difference between the finance of traditional banking and funding transfer. New protocols will need to be introduced with low-layer solvent to manage these issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Anime">
    Anime Entertainment has already captured the total industry of 31 Billion USD in the 2023. With blockchain co-existing with few several NFT Projects, some Projects have garnered traction in creating communities and customers all across the platform, creating a shared and owned IP Branding. The industry is expected to grow at a (CAGR) of 9.8% to 2030. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="AI">
    As most big tech is chasing to train out new AI models, be it LLM and Image Manipulation models, AI will conquer the part of creator industry. SMEs and other startups will look into integrating AI models to benefit the process of their application. The process however is much complicated at thought to provide a fast latency unless costs of hardware can be cheaper in the coming years with new computing hardware.

## System Integration and Development

### What should be considered when developing a new system?

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="wrench" title="Business use-case">
  As any system is pre-developed, a use-case that is beneficial for both the stakeholders and Community/Customer is required. A system should always solve or to mitigate a related pre-existing issue, as well bring in entertainment and retention rate.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="wrench" title="Design">
  The design of any system should meet the standard needs of modern design. Providing an intuitive flow for the user.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="wrench" title="Remove any excessive feature and work downwards">
  Any high level system should be drilled down to meet the system goal, as to remove any unecessary/ redundant features. Developing a non-viable use-case is a wastage of funds and time.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="wrench" title="Security and regression">
Testing and any systems and check for security vulnerabilities is the upmost important for any pre-release. It mitigates any potential issues that will be brought to the table.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Developer for developer

The best case of system design is to have something that's easy to integrate and properly documented down for the other users. A core believe of mine is to create something beneficial for other developers as to integrate part of the system in their to whatever problem they seek to solve, or a use-case they seek to explore.
